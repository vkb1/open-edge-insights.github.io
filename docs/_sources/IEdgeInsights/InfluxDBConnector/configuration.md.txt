## `Configuration`

All the InfluxDBConnector module configuration are added into etcd (distributed
key-value data store) under `AppName` as mentioned in the
environment section of this app's service definition in docker-compose.

If `AppName` is `InfluxDBConnector`, then the app's config would look like as below
 for `/InfluxDBConnector/config` key in Etcd:
 ```
    "influxdb": {
            "retention": "1h30m5s",
            "username": "admin",
            "password": "admin123",
            "dbname": "datain",
            "ssl": "True",
            "verifySsl": "False",
            "port": "8086"
        }
 ```

In case of nested json data, by default InfluxDBConnector will flatten the nested json and push
the flat data to InfluxDB, In order to avoid the flattening of any particular nested key please mention the
tag key in the [ignore_attributes.cfg](../build/config/ignore_attributes.cfg) present in config directory
in docker setup. Currently "defects" key is ignored from flattening. Every key to be ignored has to be in newline.

 for example,
 ```
   ignore_keys = [ "Key1", "Key2", "Key3" ]
 ```
By default, all the keys in the data schema will be pushed to InfluxDB as fields. In case if tags are present in data schema,
it can be mentioned in the [etcd_pre_load.json](../build/provision/config/etcd_pre_load.json) then the data pushed to InfluxDB, will have fields and tags both.
Currently, no tags are present in the data scheme and tag_keys is kept blank in the config file.

for example,
```
  tag_keys = [ "Tag1", "Tag2" ]
```
