Using video accelerators
========================

EII supports running inference on ``CPU``\ , ``GPU``\ , ``MYRIAD``\ (NCS2), and ``HDDL`` devices by accepting ``device`` value ("CPU"|"GPU"|"MYRIAD"|"HDDL"), part of the ``udf`` object configuration in ``udfs``
key. The ``device`` field in UDF config of ``udfs`` key in ``VideoIngestion`` and ``VideoAnalytics`` configs can either be changed in the `eii_config.json <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/eii_config.json>`_
before provisioning (or reprovision it again after the change) or at run-time via EtcdUI. For more details on the udfs config,
check `common/udfs/README.html <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_.

**Note**\ : There is an initial delay of upto ~30s while running inference on ``GPU`` (only for the first frame) as dynamically certain packages get created during runtime.


* 
  For actual deployment in case USB camera is required then mount the device node of the USB camera for ``ia_video_ingestion`` service. When multiple USB cameras are connected to host m/c the required camera should be identified with the device node and mounted.

    Eg: Mount the two USB cameras connected to the host m/c with device node as ``video0`` and ``video1``

  .. code-block:: yaml

        ia_video_ingestion:
          ...
          devices:
            - "/dev/dri"
            - "/dev/video0:/dev/video0"
            - "/dev/video1:/dev/video1"

    Note: /dev/dri is needed for Graphic drivers

* 
  **To run on MYRIAD devices**


  * 
    To run inference on ``MYRIAD`` device ``root`` user permissions needs to be used at runtime. To enable root user at runtime in either ``ia_video_ingestion``\ , ``ia_video_analytics`` or any of the custom udf services add ``user: root`` command in the respective docker-compose.yml file.

    Eg: To use ``MYRAID`` device in ``ia_video_analytics`` service refer the below example

    .. code-block:: yaml

        ia_video_analytics:
          ...
          user: root

* 
  **To run on HDDL devices**


  * Download the full package for OpenVINO toolkit for Linux version "2021.4" (\ ``OPENVINO_IMAGE_VERSION`` used in `build/.env <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/.env>`_\ ) from the official website
    (https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download/free-download-linux).

  Please refer to the OpenVINO links below for to install and running the HDDL daemon on host.


  #. OpenVINO install:
     https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2021.4/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html#install-openvino
  #. 
     HDDL daemon setup:
     https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2021.4/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux_ivad_vpu.html

     **NOTE**\ : OpenVINO 2021.4 installation creates a symbolic link to latest installation with filename as ``openvino_2021`` instead of ``openvino``. Hence one can create a symbolic link with filename as ``openvino`` to the latest installation using the below steps.

     .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd /opt/intel
        $ sudo ln -s <OpenVINO latest installation> openvino

          Eg: sudo ln -s openvino_2021.4.394 openvino

        In case there are older versions of OpenVINO installed on the host system please un-install them.

        When running on HDDL devices, the HDDL daemon should be running in a different terminal, or in the background like shown below on the host m/c.

        ```sh
        $ source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
        $ $HDDL_INSTALL_DIR/bin/hddldaemon


     * For actual deployment one could choose to mount only the required devices for services using OpenVINO with HDDL (\ ``ia_video_analytics`` or ``ia_video_ingestion``\ ) in `docker-compose.yml <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_.

     Eg: Mount only the Graphics and HDDL ion device for ``ia_video_anaytics`` service

     .. code-block::

         ia_video_analytics:
            ...
            devices:
                    - "/dev/dri"
                    - "/dev/ion:/dev/ion"

* 
  **Running on Intel(R) Processor Graphics (GPU/iGPU)**

  **Note**\ : The below step is required only for 11th gen Intel Processors

  Upgrade the kernel version to 5.8 and install the required drivers from the below OpenVINO link:
  https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html#additional-GPU-steps

  **Troubleshooting issues for MYRIAD(NCS2) devices**


  * 
    Following is an workaround can be excercised if in case user observes ``NC_ERROR`` during device initialization of NCS2 stick.
     While running EII if NCS2 devices failed to initialize properly then user can re-plug the device for the init to happen freshly.
     User can verify the successfull initialization by executing ***dmesg**** & **\ *lsusb*\ **  as below:

    .. code-block:: sh

        lsusb | grep "03e7" (03e7 is the VendorID and 2485 is one of the  productID for MyriadX)

     ```sh
     dmesg > dmesg.txt
     [ 3818.214919] usb 3-4: new high-speed USB device number 10 using xhci_hcd
     [ 3818.363542] usb 3-4: New USB device found, idVendor=03e7, idProduct=2485
     [ 3818.363546] usb 3-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
     [ 3818.363548] usb 3-4: Product: Movidius MyriadX
     [ 3818.363550] usb 3-4: Manufacturer: Movidius Ltd.
     [ 3818.363552] usb 3-4: SerialNumber: 03e72485

     [ 3831.134804] usb 3-4: new high-speed USB device number 11 using xhci_hcd
     [ 3831.283430] usb 3-4: New USB device found, idVendor=03e7, idProduct=2485
     [ 3831.283433] usb 3-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
     [ 3831.283436] usb 3-4: Product: Movidius MyriadX

  **Troubleshooting issues for HDDL devices**


  * 
    Please verify the hddldaemon started on host m/c to verify if it is using the libraries of the correct OpenVINO version used in `build/.env <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/.env>`_. One could enable the ``device_snapshot_mode`` to ``full`` in $HDDL_INSTALL_DIR/config/hddl_service.config on host m/c to get the complete snapshot of the hddl device.

  * 
    Please refer OpenVINO 2021.4 release notes in the below link for new features and changes from the previous versions.
