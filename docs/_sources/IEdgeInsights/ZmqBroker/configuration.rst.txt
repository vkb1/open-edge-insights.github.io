Configuration
-------------

.. note::  The JSON schema for the configuration properties of the ZeroMQ
   Broker can be found in the, "schema.json", file.


Configuration of the ZeroMQ Broker is predominantly accomplished from the
EII Configuration Manager APIs. However, it can also be configured via JSON
files, as described in the Usage section below. The configuration via JSON
files is only for development/debugging purposes. This section will focus on
the preduction configuration of the broker.

The configuration of the broker falls into two main areas:


#. **Application/Service Configuration** - Configuration of the runtime behavior
#. **Interface Configuration** - Configuration of the networking interfaces
    (i.e. frontend and backend sockets)

Aside from the interface and service configuration, there are two properties
that are set via environmental variables: ``AppName`` and ``DEV_MODE``. The
``AppName`` variable determines how the service quries its configuration using
the Configuration Manager APIs. For docker-compose, this is set in the
``environment`` section of the, "docker-compose.yml", file under the
``ia_zmq_broker`` section. The default value for this is ``ZmqBroker``.

The ``DEV_MODE`` variable sets whether or not the broker will attempt to use
certificates with the Configuration Manager APIs and over any TCP connections.
This also is obtainerd from the ``environment`` section of the, "docker-compose.yml",
file.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
There are some other configuration properties in the ``environment`` section of
the, "docker-compose.yml", file. These are provided to the service from the,
"build/.env", file. See the EII User Guide for more details.

The following two sections cover that various configuration properties the
broker supports for interfaces and application configuration.

Application/Service Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The broker supports two configuration parameters; one for the Linux scheduler
policy and the other for the scheduler priority. These two properties are
applied to the main thread which is running the ZeroMQ proxy.

The configuration values must be specified in the config.json prior to running
the ``builder.py`` script or eii_config.json after using the ``builder.py``
script.

The table below specifies the details for these parameters. Note that neither of
these are required in the configuration and should only be set if the user
knows they need to have a certain scheduling policy and priority for the broker.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``sched_policy``
     - ``string``
     - Scheduling policy to set for the main thread. Must be: ``SCHED_OTHER``\ , ``SCHED_IDLE``\ , ``SCHED_BATCH``\ , ``SCHED_FIFO``\ , or ``SCHED_RR``.
   * - ``sched_priority``
     - ``integer``
     - Sets the priority for the thread. Must be between ``0`` and ``99``. Only valid for ``SCHED_FIFO`` and ``SCHED_RR`` policies.


An example of applying these two settings to the ZeroMQ Broker's
configuration is shown below. In this example, the configuration is an
excerpt from the, 'IEdgeInsights/build/provision/config/eii_config.json",
generated while using the ``builder.py`` script.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       // ... omitted ...

       "/ZmqBroker/config": {
           "sched_policy": "SCHED_FIFO",
           "sched_priority": 42
       }

       // ... omitted ...
   }

.. note::  There will also be an ``/ZmqBroker/interfaces`` section associated
   with the broker, but that is covered in the next section.


The configuration above sets the Linux scheduler policy to ``SCHED_FIFO`` and its
priority to ``42``. As stated before, this can also be left entirely empty and the
broker thread will default to the Linux default thread scheduling policy/priority.

Interface Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration of the networking interfaces for the ZeroMQ Broker is
divided into two sections, "Subscribers", and, "Publishers". The, "Subscribers",
sections sets the configuration for the **frontend** socket (since it subscribes
to the messages coming from publishers), and the, "Publishers", section
determines the configuration for the **backend** socket.

The Configuration Manager API assumes that the, "Subscribers", and, "Publishers",
section is a list. However, since the ZeroMQ Broker does not use multiple
publisher and subscriber sockets, the lists must only contain one element.

The single JSON object which is expected to be in the, "Subscribers", and,
"Publishers", sections is essentially the same. An example is shown below of
the interfaces configuration for a broker instance with TCP sockets for both
the **frontend** and **backend**.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Subscribers": [
           {
               "Name": "frontend",
               "Type": "zmq_tcp",
               "EndPoint": "0.0.0.0:60514",
               "Topics": ["*"],
               "PublisherAppName": "*",
               "AllowedClients": ["*"]
           }
       ],
       "Publishers": [
           {
               "Name": "backend",
               "Type": "zmq_tcp",
               "EndPoint": "0.0.0.0:60515",
               "Topics": ["*"],
               "AllowedClients": ["*"]
           }
       ]
   }

The primary difference to point out is that the, "Name", and, "Topics",
fields are different. For the, "Subscribers", the, "Name", MUST be the
string ``frontend``\ , and the, "Topics", list must only contain a single value in
it, which is ``"*"``. For the, "Publishers", object the same rules hold
true. Note that, "AllowedClients", also has a ``"*"`` in it. If you wish to only
allowed certain services to connect to the broker, then change this to a list
of the app name's of the services which are allowd to connect.

This allows the broker to query specific configuration objects using the
defined names ``frontend`` and ``backend``. It is important to note that if the
deployment needs to limit the services which can connect to the broker, then
the, "AllowedClients", list should be modified to contain only the app names of
the services allowed to connect.

For IPC sockets, the configuration is very similar, except that the, "EndPoint",
and, "Type", values are different (as shown in the example below).

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Subscribers": [
           {
               "Name": "frontend",
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",
               "EndPoint": {
                   "SocketDir": "/tmp/socks",
                   "SocketFile": "frontend-socket"
               },
               "PublisherAppName": "*",
               "Topics": ["*"],
               "AllowedClients": ["*"]
           }
       ],
       "Publishers": [
           {
               "Name": "backend",
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",
               "EndPoint": {
                   "SocketDir": "/tmp/socks",
                   "SocketFile": "backend-socket"
               },
               "Topics": ["*"],
               "AllowedClients": ["*"]
           }
       ]
   }

In the example above, note that the, "Type", values is now ``zmq_ipc`` and the,
"EndPoint", is a JSON object which defines the socket directory and file to use
for the sockets.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

There are two important notes to be aware of with the configurations presented
above:


#. Although the configurations above showcase using IPC and TCP for both the
    frontend and backend sockets they can be used in any combination (e.g. the
    broker can use an IPC socket for the frontend and TCP for the backend).
#. When using IPC sockets, the name of the, "SocketFile", must also be specified
    for all subscribers or publishers which will be connecting to that socket.
