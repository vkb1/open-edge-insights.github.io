#. `Udfs Configuration <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/blob/master/udfs/README.md>`_
#. `Etcd Secrets Configuration <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/Etcd_Secrets_Configuration.md>`_ and
#. `MessageBus Configuration <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/libs/ConfigMgr/README.md#interfaces>`_ respectively.
#. `JSON schema <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/schema.json>`_

----

All the app module configuration are added into distributed key-value store under ``AppName`` env, as mentioned in the environment section of this app's service definition in docker-compose. If ``AppName`` is ``VideoIngestion``\ , then the app's config would be fetched from
``/VideoIngestion/config`` key via EII Configuration Manager.

.. note:: \ :


   * 
     Developer mode related overrides go into docker-compose-dev.override.yml

   * 
     For ``jpeg`` encoding type, ``level`` is the quality from ``0 to 100`` (the higher is the better)

   * 
     For ``png`` encoding type, ``level`` is the compression level from ``0 to 9``. A higher value means a smaller size and longer compression time.

   * 
     One can use `JSON validator tool <https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/>`_ for validating the app configuration against the above schema.

  #### GenICam GigE or USB3 Camera

  **Refer `GenICam GigE/USB3.0 Camera Support <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/docs/generic_plugin_doc.md>`_ for information/configuration on GenICam GigE/USB3 camera support.**

  **Pre-requisities for working with GenICam compliant cameras:**

  The following are the pre-requisites for working with GeniCam compliant cameras. Please note that these changes need to be reverted while working with other cameras such as realsense, rtsp and usb(v4l2 driver compliant).

  Refer the below snip of ``ia_video_ingestion`` service to add the required changes in `docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>`_ file of the respective Ingestion service(including custom udf services). Once the changes are made make sure `docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>`_ is executed before building and running the services.

  **For GenICam GigE Camera:**

.. code-block::

     ```yaml
     ia_video_ingestion:
       # Add root user
       user: root
       # Add network mode host
       network_mode: host
       # Please make sure that the above commands are not added under environment section and also take care about the indentations in the compose file.
       ...
       environment:
       ...
         # Add HOST_IP to no_proxy and ETCD_HOST
         no_proxy: "${RTSP_CAMERA_IP},<HOST_IP>"
         ETCD_HOST: "<HOST_IP>"
       ...
       # Comment networks section as below as it will throw an error when network mode host is used.
       # networks:
         # - eii
       # Comment ports section as below
       # ports:
       # - 64013:64013
     ```

  **For GenIcam USB3.0 Camera:**

.. code-block::

     ```yaml
     ia_video_ingestion:
       # Add root user
       user: root
       ...
       environment:
         # refer [GenICam GigE/USB3.0 Camera Support](https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/docs/generic_plugin_doc.md) to install the respective camera SDK
         # Setting GENICAM value to the respective camera/GenTL producer which needs to be used
         GENICAM: "<CAMERA/GenTL>"
       ...
     ```

   > **Note:**
   >  * In case one notices GenICam cameras not getting initialized during runtime then try executing `docker system prune` command on the host system and then removing the GenICam specific semaphore files under `/dev/shm/` path of the host system. `docker system prune` command will remove all stopped containers, networks not used by at least one container, dangling images and build cache which could prevent the plugin from accessing the device.
   >  * In case one notices `Feature not writable` while working with GenICam cameras please reset the device using camera software or using the reset property of [Generic Plugin README](https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/src-gst-gencamsrc/README).
   >  * In `IPC` mode if Ingestion service is running with `root` privilige then `ia_video_analytics` and `ia_visualizer` service subscribing to it must also run with `root` privileges.
   >  * In multi-node scenario, replace <HOST_IP> in "no_proxy" with leader node IP address.
   >  * In TCP mode of communication, msgbus subscribers and clients of VideoIngestion are required to configure the "EndPoint" in config.json with host IP and port under "Subscribers" or "Clients" interfaces section.

  ``Gstreamer Ingestor``


  * 
    ``GenICam GigE/USB3.0 cameras``

    .. code-block:: javascript

       {
         "type": "gstreamer",
         "pipeline": "gencamsrc serial=<DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> pixel-format=<PIXEL_FORMAT> ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
       }

    ..

       **Note:** 


       * Generic Plugin can work only with GenICam compliant cameras and only with gstreamer ingestor.
       * The above gstreamer pipeline was tested with Basler and IDS GigE cameras. 
       * If ``serial`` is not provided then the first connected camera in the device list will be used. 
       * If ``pixel-format`` is not provided then the default ``mono8`` pixel format will be used.
       * If ``width`` and ``height`` properies are not set then gencamsrc plugin will set the maximum resolution supported by the camera.



  * 
    ``Hardware trigger based ingestion with gstreamer ingestor``

    .. code-block:: javascript

       {
        "type": "gstreamer",
        "pipeline": "gencamsrc serial=<DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> pixel-format=<PIXEL_FORMAT> trigger-selector=FrameStart trigger-source=Line1 trigger-activation=RisingEdge hw-trigger-timeout=100 acquisition-mode=singleframe ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
       }

    ..

       **Note:**


       * For PCB usecase use the ``width`` and ``height`` properties of gencamsrc to set the resolution to ``1920x1200`` and make sure it is pointing to the rotating pcb boards as seen in ``pcb_d2000.avi`` video file for pcb filter to work. 


    One can refer the below example pipeline:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "type": "gstreamer",
          "pipeline": "gencamsrc serial=<DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER> pixel-format=ycbcr422_8 width=1920 height=1200 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
        }

  ``Gstreamer Ingestor``

  .. code-block:: javascript

       {
         "type": "gstreamer",
         "pipeline": "rtspsrc location=\"rtsp://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<RTSP_CAMERA_IP>:<PORT>/<FEED>\" latency=100 ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! vaapih264dec ! vaapipostproc format=bgrx ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! appsink"
       }

  ..

     **Note:** The RTSP URI of the physical camera depends on how it is configured using the camera software. One can use VLC Network Stream to verify the RTSP URI to confirm the RTSP source.

RealSense Depth Camera
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* 
  ``RealSense Ingestor``

  .. code-block:: javascript

        "ingestor": {
             "type": "realsense",
             "serial": "<DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER>",
             "framerate": <FRAMERATE>,
             "imu_on": true
         },

  ..

     **Note**


     * RealSense Ingestor was tested with Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i
     * 
       RealSense Ingestor does not support poll_interval. Please use framerate to reduce the ingestion fps if required.

     * 
       If ``serial`` config is not provided then the first realsense camera in the device list will be connected.

     * 
       If ``framerate`` config is not provided then the default framerate of 30 will be applied. Please make sure that the framerate provided is compatible with both the color and depth sensor of the realsense camera. With D435i camera only framerate 6,15,30 and 60 is supported and tested.

     * 
       IMU stream will work only if the realsense camera model supports the IMU feature. The default value for ``imu_on`` is set to false.


  ----

.. note:: \ : 

   For all video and camera streams please make sure you are using appropriate UDF configuration. One may not get the expected output in the Visualizer/WebVisualizer screen if the udf is not compatible with the video source.

   If one is not sure about the compatibility of the udf and video source then 'dummy' udf can be used. It won't do any analytics on the video and hence won't filter any of the video frames. You will, therefore, see the video streamed by the camera as it is on the video output screen in Visualizer/WebVisualizer.

   Refer below configuration for 'dummy' UDF:


.. code-block:: javascript

       "udfs": [{
           "name": "dummy",
           "type": "python"
       }]

..

   Same changes need to be applied in VideoAnalytics configuration if it is subscribing to VideoIngestion.
