VideoIngestion Module
=====================

The VideoIngestion(VI) module is mainly responsibly for ingesting the video frames
coming from a video source like video file or basler/RTSP/USB camera
into the EII stack for further processing. Additionally, by having VI run with
classifier and post-processing UDFs, VI can perform the job of VA(VideoAnalytics)
service also.

The high level logical flow of VideoIngestion pipeline is as below:


#. App reads the application configuration via EII Configuration Manager which
   has details of ``ingestor``\ , ``encoding`` and ``udfs``.
#. Based on the ingestor configuration, app reads the video frames from
   the video file or camera.
#. [\ ``Optional``\ ] The read frames are passed onto one or more chained native/python
   UDFs for doing any pre-processing (passing thru UDFs is an optional thing and
   not required if one doesn't want to perform any pre-processing on the
   ingested frames). With chaining of UDFs supported, one can also have
   classifier UDFs and any post-processing UDFs like resize etc., configured in
   ``udfs`` key to get the classified results. One can refer
   `../common/video/udfs/README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/blob/master/udfs/README.md>`_ for more details.
#. App gets the msgbus endpoint configuration from system environment and
   based on the configuration, app publishes the data on the mentioned topic
   on EII MessageBus.

.. note:: \ :
   Below usecases are suitable for single node deployment where one can avoid the
   overhead of VA(VideoAnalytics) service.


   #. If VI(VideoIngestion) service is configured with an UDF that does the
      classification, then one may choose to not to have VA service as all
      pre-processing, classification and any post-processing can be handled in VI
      itself with the usage of multiple UDFs.
   #. If VI(VideoIngestion) service is using GVA(Gstreamer Video Analytics)
      elements also, then one may choose to not to have VA service as all
      pre-processing, classification and any post-processing(using vappi gstreamer
      elements) can be done in gstreamer pipeline itself. Also, the post-processing
      here can be configured by having multiple UDFs in VI if needed.
