``Camera independent Software Trigger way of video ingestion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* 
  Software triggering way of video ingestion is a solution which enables to control video ingestion from all the supported ingestors and camera configurations.

* 
  The regular way of video ingestion is autonomous i.e. as soon as the Video Ingestion micro-service is started the ingestion starts automatically using the video source (file/camera). There is no way to control the ingestion without stopping the ingestion micro-service itself. Software trigger feature provides a mechanism to start & stop video ingestion using software triggers sent by the client application.

----

``Generic Server in VideoIngestion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* VI generic server responds back to the client with the return values specific to the command. There is a total flexibility in sending the number & type of arguments back to client which is totally dependent on the command.


* Example JSON format for incoming payload from client to server to initialize software trigger:
  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
        "init_state" : "running"
     }

**VideoIngestion micro-service exposes the functionality of software trigger in the following ways:**

  1) It can accept software trigger to "START_INGESTION"/ "STOP_INGESTION"/ "SNAPSHOT" from any client utility which uses the EII messagebus over server-client model.

  2) The software trigger functionality of VI is demonstrated using an sample baremetal utility called "SW_Trigger_utility", which is shipped with the VideoIngestion code in tools repo, the details of the usage of this utility is mentioned in `../../tools/SWTriggerUtility/README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/SWTriggerUtility/README.md>`_.

.. note:: \ : When the ``init_state`` value is ``running`` then ingestor is started without any sw trigger from the client. In order to control the ingestor using the sw trigger utility change the value to ``stopped``. To refer the available option to generate the sw trigger refer `../tools/SWTriggerUtility/README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/SWTriggerUtility/README.md>`_


**The supported commands in the VI Gerenic Server are:**


#. 
   START_INGESTION: to start the ingestor

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "START_INGESTION"
         }

#. 
   STOP_INGESTION: to stop the ingestor

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "STOP_INGESTION"
         }

#. 
   SNAPSHOT: to get the frame snapshot and feed in one frame into the video data pipeline

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "SNAPSHOT"
         }

   ..

      **Note**\ : In order to use ``SNAPSHOT`` functionality one needs to enable the sw trigger mode and make sure ingestion should be stopped before getting the frame snapshot capture.
