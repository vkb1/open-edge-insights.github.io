Video File with gstreamer ingestor (multifilesrc)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**NOTE**\ :


* 
  In case one does not want to loop the video with multifilesrc element then set the ``loop`` property to ``FALSE``

* 
  In case one wants to play the video for specific number of iterations set the ``loop`` property to ``FALSE`` and ``stop-index`` property to the number of iteration starting with 0 which would play it once. Setting the ``loop`` property to ``TRUE`` will override the ``stop-index`` property.

* 
  The ``loop`` property of ``multifilesrc`` plugin does not support video files of MP4 format. Hence MP4 video files will not loop and the recommendation is to transcode the video file to AVI format.

* 
  In case one notices general stream error with multifilesrc element when certain video files are used then transcode the video file to ``H264`` video with ``.avi`` container format to ensure the compatibity of the format of the video file.
