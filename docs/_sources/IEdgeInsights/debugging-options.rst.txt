Debugging options
=================


#. 
   To check if all the EII images are built successfully, use cmd: ``docker images|grep ia`` and
   to check if all containers are running, use cmd: ``docker ps`` (\ ``one should see all the dependency containers and EII containers up and running``\ ). If you see issues where the build is failing due to non-reachability to Internet, please ensure you have correctly configured proxy settings and restarted docker service. Even after doing this, if you are running into the same issue, please add below instrcutions to all the dockerfiles in ``build\dockerfiles`` at the top after the LABEL instruction and retry the building EII images:

   .. code-block:: sh

       ENV http_proxy http://proxy.iind.intel.com:911
       ENV https_proxy http://proxy.iind.intel.com:911

#. 
   ``docker ps`` should list all the enabled containers which are included in docker-compose.yml

#. 
   To verify if the default video pipeline with EII is working fine i.e., from video ingestion->video analytics->visualizer, please check the visualizer UI

#. 
   ``/opt/intel/eii`` root directory gets created - This is the installation path for EII:


   * ``data/`` - stores the backup data for persistent imagestore and influxdb
   * ``sockets/`` - stores the IPC ZMQ socket files

**Note**\ :


#. 
   Few useful docker-compose and docker commands:


   * ``docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build`` - builds all the service containers. To build a single service container, use ``docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build [serv_cont_name]``
   * ``docker-compose down`` - stops and removes the service containers
   * ``docker-compose up -d`` - brings up the service containers by picking the changes done in ``docker-compose.yml``
   * ``docker ps`` - check running containers
   * ``docker ps -a`` - check running and stopped containers
   * ``docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`` - stops all the containers
   * ``docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`` - removes all the containers. Useful when you run into issue of already container is in use.
   * `docker compose cli <https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/>`_
   * `docker compose reference <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/>`_
   * `docker cli <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#configuration-files>`_

#. 
   If you want to run the docker images separately i.e, one by one, run the command ``docker-compose run --no-deps [service_cont_name]`` Eg: ``docker-compose run --name ia_video_ingestion --no-deps      ia_video_ingestion`` to run VI container and the switch ``--no-deps`` will not bring up it's dependencies mentioned in the docker-compose file. If the container is not launching, there could be
   some issue with entrypoint program which could be overrided by providing this extra switch ``--entrypoint /bin/bash`` before the service container name in the docker-compose run command above, this would let one inside the container and run the actual entrypoint program from the container's terminal to rootcause the issue. If the container is running and one wants to get inside, use cmd: ``docker-compose exec [service_cont_name] /bin/bash`` or ``docker exec -it [cont_name] /bin/bash``

#. 
   Best way to check logs of containers is to use command: ``docker logs -f [cont_name]``. If one wants to see all the docker-compose service container logs at once, then just run
   ``docker-compose logs -f``
