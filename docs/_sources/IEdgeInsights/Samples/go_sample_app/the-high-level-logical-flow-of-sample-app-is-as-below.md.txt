# The high level logical flow of Sample App is as below:

1. Publisher contacts to ETCD service, using the 'msgbusutil'
(IEdgeInsights/common/util/msgbusutil) library. It fetches it's private key
and allowed client's public keys. Then it creates the publisher object and
starts publishing the sample data at given topic(topic name: publish_test).

2. Server contacts to ETCD service, and fetches it's private key and
allowed client's public keys. Then it creates a server object according
to given service name and waits for the client's request.

3. Subscriber contacts to ETCD service using the 'msgbusutil'
(IEdgeInsights/common/util/msgbusutil) library. And fetches it's private
and public key and public key of publisher. It then creates the subscriber
object(which subscribes to the same topic: publish_test) and starts
receiving the data and prints the same onto a console.

4. Client contacts to ETCD service, and fetches its private key and public
key of server. Then it creates a client object and sends a request to the
server and gets the response back.
