Sample Python APP for EII platform
==================================

Short Description of App containers
===================================

This is a sample Python application which demonstrates the usage of EII core libraries like EIIMessageBus and ConfigManager.

In this app, there is a publisher, a subscriber a client and a
server. Subscriber-client and publisher-server are running inside independent
containers(container names are ia_python_publisher, ia_python_subscriber).

**NOTE**\ :


#. 
   ia_python_publisher container comprises of both publisher and server
   functionality.

#. 
   ia_python_subscriber container comprises of both subscriber and
   client functionality.

The high level logical flow of Sample App is as below:

.. code-block::

   1. Publisher contacts to ETCD service, using the 'msgbusutil'
      (IEdgeInsights/common/util/msgbusutil) library. It fetches it's private key
      and allowed client's public keys. Then it creates the publisher object and
      starts publishing the sample data at given topic(topic name: publish_test).

   2. Server contacts to ETCD service, and fetches it's private key and
      allowed client's public keys. Then it creates a server object according
      to given service name and waits for the client's request.


As mentioned in **NOTE**\ , the publisher and server are running inside
ia_python_publisher container.

.. code-block::

   3. Subscriber contacts to ETCD service using the 'msgbusutil'
      (IEdgeInsights/common/util/msgbusutil) library. And fetches it's private
      and public key and public key of publisher. It then creates the subscriber
      object(which subscribes to the same topic: publish_test) and starts
      receiving the data and prints the same onto a console.

   4. Client contacts to ETCD service, and fetches its private key and public
      key of server. Then it creates a client object and sends a request to the
      server and gets the response back.


As mentioned in **NOTE**\ , the subscriber and client are running inside
ia_python_publisher container.
