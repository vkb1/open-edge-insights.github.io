1. "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings during docker-compose up
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* 
  Problem Description:

  Issue in starting InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor and Grafana Services like InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor, Grafana whose ports
  are exposed to start the service might fail to start during "docker-compose up".

* 
  Error description:

  .. code-block::

       ERROR: for ia_kapacitor  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

       ERROR: for ia_grafana  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

       ERROR: for ia_influxdbconnector "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

       docker.errors.InvalidArgument: "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

* 
  Possible Cause:

  .. code-block::

       docker-compose might have been installed using "pip" where version mismatch might be causing the issue.


* 
  Solution:

  Installation of docker-compose using "curl" as mentiond in `Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md>`_ will solve the
  issue. Also, following the below command should solve the issue.

  .. code-block:: sh

     $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     $ pip3 uninstall docker-compose
     $ sudo curl L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-`uname -s``uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2. eii_libs_installer.sh script failing during bare-metal execution
-------------------------------------------------------------------


* 
  Problem Description:

  One might run into issue of $GOPATH not being set appropriately which could result in the EII librarires installation failure when run on bare-metal

* 
  Error description:

  .. code-block::

       CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:63 (message):
       – $GOPATH envronmental variable is not set

       – Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

* 
  Possible Cause:

  .. code-block::

       If "GO" is already installed in the system, eii_libs_installer script skips the installation of it.

       In this case where GO is already installed, GOPATH needs to be set in the system. If not, then above error occurs.

* 
  Solution:

  Installing GO through eii_libs_installer script will install GO and set the required env variables like GOPATH. If not, then one need to set GOPATH
  environment variable with appropriate path.

  .. code-block:: sh

     $ export GOPATH=<path_to_where_GO_is_installed>
