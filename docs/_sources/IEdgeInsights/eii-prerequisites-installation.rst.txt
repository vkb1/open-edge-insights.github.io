EII Prerequisites installation
==============================

.. note:: 


   * Recommended ``Docker CLI & Daemon version`` is ``20.10.6``
   * Recommended ``docker-compose version`` is ``1.29.0``


The script automates the installation & configuration of all the prerequisite software needed to be installed on a system with a freshly installed operating system to make the system ready for provisioning, building and running EII stack. These pre-requisite softwares include:


#. **docker daemon**
#. **docker client**
#. **docker-compose**
#. **Python packages**

The script checks if docker & docker-compose are already installed in the system. If not installed, then it installs the intended version of the docker & docker-compose which is mentioned in the script.
If docker and/or docker-compose are already installed in the system but the installed version of the docker/docker-compose is older than the intended docker/docker-compose version (which is mentioned in the script) then the script uninstalls the older version of docker/docker-compose & re-installs the intended version mentioned in the script. The script also configures the proxy settings for docker client and docker daemon to connect to internet.

The `build/pre_requisites.sh <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/pre_requisites.sh>`_ script also does proxy setting configuration for both system wide proxy & docker proxy. The script prompts for the proxy address to be entered by the user, if the system is behind a proxy.
The script also configures proxy setting system wide ``/etc/environment`` and for docker by taking the proxy value as user input if the system is running behind proxy. The proxy settings for ``/etc/apt/apt.conf`` is also set by this script to enable apt updates & installations.

----

**Note**\ :


* It is recommended to install the required ``docker-compose version``
  which is ``1.29.0``. Older version of docker-compose binary less than 1.29.0 may not work with the video-usecase docker-compose.yml files. It is observed that ``device_cgroup_rules`` command is not supported in certain docker-compose binaries versions less than ``1.29.0``.
* 
  If one still needs to use the older versions of docker-compose then
  ``device_cgroup_rules`` command needs to be commented in ``ia_video_ingestion`` and ``ia_video_analytics`` service which could result in limited inference and device support.

  .. code-block:: yaml

           ia_video_ingestion:
             ...
             #device_cgroup_rules:
               #- 'c 189:* rmw'
               #- 'c 209:* rmw'

    After making changes to the docker-compose.yml file refer ``Using builder script`` section to re-run ``builder.py`` script before running the services using ``docker-compose up``

#. **Steps to run the pre-requisites script is as follows**\ :

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
   $ sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh --help

   Usage :: sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh [OPTION...]

   List of available options...

   --proxy         proxies, required when the gateway/edge node running EII (or any of EII profile) is connected behind proxy

   --help / -h         display this help and exit

   Note : If --proxy option is not provided then script will run without proxy

   Different use cases...

                   1. RUNS WITHOUT PROXY
                   $sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh


                   2.RUNS WITH PROXY
                   $sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh --proxy="proxy.intel.com:891"


#. 
   **Optional:** For enabling full security for production deployments, make sure host machine and docker daemon are configured with below security recommendations. `build/docker_security_recommendation.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/docker_security_recommendation.md>`_

#. 
   **Optional:** If one wishes to enable log rotation for docker containers

    There are two ways to configure logging driver for docker containers


   * 
     Set logging driver as part of docker daemon (\ **applies to all docker containers by default**\ ):


     * 
       Configure ``json-file`` driver as default logging driver by following `https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/ <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`_. Sample json-driver config which can be copied to ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` is provided below.

       .. code-block::

            {
                "log-driver": "json-file",
                "log-opts": {
                "max-size": "10m",
                "max-file": "5"
                }
            }

     * 
       Reload the docker daemon

       .. code-block::

            $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

     * Restart docker
       .. code-block::

            $ sudo systemctl restart docker

   * 
     Set logging driver as part of docker compose which is conatiner specific and which always overwrites 1st option (i.e /etc/docker/daemon.json)

       Example to enable logging driver only for video_ingestion service:

     .. code-block::

          ia_video_ingestion:
              ...
              ...
              logging:
               driver: json-file
               options:
                max-size: 10m
                max-file: 5
