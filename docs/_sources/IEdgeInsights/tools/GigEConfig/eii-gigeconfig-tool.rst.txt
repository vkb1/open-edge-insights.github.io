EII GigEConfig tool
===================

The GigEConfig tool can be used to read the Basler Camera properties from the Pylon Feature Stream file and construct a gstreamer pipeline with the required camera features. The gstreamer pipeline which is generated by the tool can either be printed on the console or can be used to update the config manager storage.

**Note**\ :This tool has been verified with Basler camera only as the PFS file which is a pre-requisite to this tool is specific to Basler Pylon Camera Software Suite.
