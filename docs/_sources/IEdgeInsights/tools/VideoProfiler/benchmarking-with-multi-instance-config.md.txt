## Benchmarking with multi instance config

1. EII supports multi instance config generation for benchmarking purposes. This can be acheived by running the [builder.py](../../build/builder.py) with certain parameters, please refer to the **Multi instance config generation** section of **EII Pre-Requisites** in [README](../../README.md) for more details.

2. For running VideoProfiler for multiple streams, run the builder with the **-v** flag provided the pre-requisites mentioned above are done. Given below is an example for generating **6** streams config:
    ```sh
        python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming.yml -v 6
    ```

  > **Note:**
  > * For multi instance monitor mode usecase, please ensure only **VideoIngestion** & **VideoAnalytics** are used as **AppName** for Publishers.
  > * Running **VideoProfiler** with **CustomUDFs** for monitor mode is supported for single stream only. If required for multiple streams, please ensure **VideoIngestion** & **VideoAnalytics** are used as **AppName**.
