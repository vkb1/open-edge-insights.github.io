# ConfigMgr 
ConfigMgr (Config manager) provides CPP/Python/Golang APIs to:
- fetch an applications configs values from the KV store.
- fetch an applications interface values from KV store for pub, sub, server and client.
- watch on application's config changes.
- generate EII MessageBus config.
- read and set /GlobalEnv variables.
- fetch env variables: appname, dev_mode

All these data are stored into the kv store of EII during the provisioning phase and can be changed   dynamically by the admin.

## Installation

The EIIUtils depends on CMake version 3.11+. For Ubuntu 18.04 this is not
the default version installed via `apt-get`. To install the correct version
of CMake and other ConfigMgr dependencies, please follow [eii_libs_installer README](../../README.md)

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX needs to be set for the installation:

```sh
    $ export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/intel/eii"
```

ConfigMgr installs to `/opt/intel/eii/lib/`. On some platforms this is not included in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by default. As a result, you must add this directory to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
otherwise you will encounter issues using the ConfigMgr. This can
be accomplished with the following `export`:

```sh
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib/
```

> **NOTE:** You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
> the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag. If different installation path is given via `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, then `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should be appended by $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.

## Install ConfigMgr with Python bindings, Go bindings, Examples, Test suits and Debug Build.

```sh
$ rm -rf build
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX -DWITH_PYTHON=ON -DWITH_GO=ON -DWITH_EXAMPLES=ON -DWITH_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

`WITH_PYTHON=ON`, `WITH_GO=ON`, `WITH_EXAMPLES=ON`, `WITH_TESTS=ON` and `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to compile ConfigMgr with Python bindings, Go bindings, Examples, Unit Tests and Debug mode respectively.

# Interfaces

ConfigMgr parses the data from the kv store (eg: etcd) and the application environment variables for its functionality.
It supports Publisher, Subscriber, Server and Client interfaces. Below are the examples for providing 
different interfaces and different usecases.

Please refer [different ways of giving endpoints](###**Note**-"endpoint"-can-be-given-in-different-ways:)

### **Publisher Interface**

## Overriding of Type and EndPoint:

In a given publisher, subscriber, client or server interfaces, the "Type" and "Endpoint" values mentioned in the respective interfaces can be overriden by setting them as env variables.

Let's take publisher as an example having multiple endpoints and below is its interface:

```javascript
{
    "Publishers": [
        {
            "Name": "default",
            "Type": "zmq_ipc",
            "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
            "Topics": [
                "camera1_stream"
            ],
            "AllowedClients": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Name": "example",
            "Type": "zmq_tcp",
            "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65015",
            "Topics": [
                "*"
            ],
            "AllowedClients": [
                "Visualizer", "VideoAnalytics"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Let's say we want to override the Type ("zmq_ipc") and Endpoint ("/EII/sockets") of the first publisher's interface (interface having "Name":"default"), then env variable should be set with below syntax.

```sh
export PUBLISHER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export PUBLISHER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"
```
In the above command `default` is the `Name` of the interface.

Similarly, we can override subscriber's, client's and server's Type and Endpoint.

```sh
export SUBSCRIBER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export SUBSCRIBER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

export SERVER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export SERVER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

export CLIENT_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export CLIENT_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"
```


Let's take publisher as an example having single endpoint and below is its interface:

```javascript
{
    "Publishers": [
        {
            "Name": "default",
            "Type": "zmq_ipc",
            "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
            "Topics": [
                "camera1_stream"
            ],
            "AllowedClients": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
}
``` 

If we want to override the Type ("zmq_ipc") and Endpoint ("/EII/sockets") of publisher's interface, then env variable should be set with below syntax.

```sh
export PUBLISHER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export PUBLISHER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"
```

Similarly, we can override subscriber's, client's and server's Type and Endpoint.

```sh
export SUBSCRIBER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export SUBSCRIBER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

export SERVER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export SERVER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

export CLIENT_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
export CLIENT_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"
```


Overriding feature of ConfigMgr will be used in orchestrated scenarios including Kubernetes.

## Broker Usecase

If publisher and subscriber wants to communicate via broker(ZmqBroker), i.e., if publisher publish data to ZmqBroker and subscriber subscribes from ZmqBroker, then the interfaces of ZmqBroker, subscriber and publisher with respect to `zmq_tcp` and `zmq_ipc` protocol as follows.

## zmq_tcp Protocol usecase

### ZmqBroker:

```javascript
{
    //X-PUB
    "Publishers": [
        {
            "AllowedClients": [

            ],
            "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:5568",
            "Name": "backend",
            "Topics": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Type": "zmq_tcp"
        }
    ],
    // X-SUB
    "Subscribers": [
        {
            "AllowedClients": [
                "*"
            ],
            "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:5569",
            "Name": "frontend",
            "PublisherAppName": "*",
            "Topics": [
                "*"

            "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:5568",

            // PublisherAppName will be "ZmqBroker" in case of brokered usecase 
            "PublisherAppName": "ZmqBroker",
            "Topics": [
                "*"
            ]

                "camera1_stream"
            ],
            // With broker usecase, AllowedClients in Publisher's interface is not required, as it acts as a subscriber to X-SUB

            // "brokered" and "BrokerAppName" should be added for ZmqBroker usecase
            "brokered": true,
            "BrokerAppName" : "ZmqBroker"

### **Note** "Endpoint" can be given in different ways:

* zmq_tcp Endpoint should look like below:

    ```javascript
    "Endpoint":"127.0.0.1:65013"
    ```

* zmq_ipc Endpoint have different ways of giving.

    - Specifying just socket directory

        ```javascript
        "Endpoint":"/EII/sockets"
        ```

    - Specifying socket directory and socket file

## Running Examples

The ConfigMgr library also supports Cpp APIs and Python & Go bindings. These APIs/bindings can be used in Cpp and Python/Go services in the EII stack to fetch required config/interfaces/msgbus config. 

Examples will only be compiled if the `WITH_EXAMPLES=ON` option is specified while running CMake.
Please refer [Examples installation](###-install-configMgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.) 

Refer the interfaces of publisher and server in [./examples/configs/VideoIngestion_interfaces.json](./examples/configs/VideoIngestion_interfaces.json) and for subscriber and client, refer [./examples/configs/VideoAnalytics_interfaces.json](./examples/configs/VideoAnalytics_interfaces.json)

Examples on demonstrating the usage of these APIs in the bindings have been given in respective sections below.
* [CPP Examples](###-cpp-examples)
* [Python Examples](###-python-examples)
* [Go Examples](###-go-examples)

## Running Unit Tests

> **NOTE:**

* The unit tests will only be compiled if the `WITH_TESTS=ON` option is specified when running CMake.
Please refer [Unit Test installation](###-install-configMgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.) installation.

* Provisioning should be done to start etcd server in dev/prod mode and to generate application specific certificates(only in prod mode).

Before executing any of the test files, please run below command from `build/tests/`
```sh
 cd ../../examples/ && source ./env.sh && cd -
```

* To run ConfigMgr unit tests
```
$ ./config_manager_unit_tests
$ ./kvstore_client-tests
```
## Creation of grpc .deb file (Optional)

**Note**: This is an optional as we have already created .deb file in the repo.
If user wants to create .deb file freshly, then one has to follow this step.

Navigate to `[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr` and run the `grpc_deb.sh`

```sh
$ sudo ./grpc_deb.sh
```

By executing the above script, `grpc-1.29.0-Linux.deb` will be created in
`[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr`.
