Running Unit Tests
------------------

.. note:: 



* 
  The unit tests will only be compiled if the ``WITH_TESTS=ON`` option is specified when running CMake.
  Please refer `Unit Test installation <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr/###-install-configMgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.>`_ installation.

Before executing any of the test files, please run below command from ``build/tests/``

.. code-block:: sh

    cd ../../examples/ && source ./env.sh && cd -


* To run ConfigMgr unit tests
