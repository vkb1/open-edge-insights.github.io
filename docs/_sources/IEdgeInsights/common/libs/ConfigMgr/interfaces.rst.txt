Interfaces
==========

ConfigMgr parses the data from the kv store (eg: etcd) and the application environment variables for its functionality.
It supports Publisher, Subscriber, Server and Client interfaces. Below are the examples for providing 
different interfaces and different usecases.

Please refer `different ways of giving endpoints <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr/###**Note**-"endpoint"-can-be-given-in-different-ways:>`_

**Publisher Interface**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Publishers": [
           {
               "Name": "default",
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",
               "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
               "Topics": [
                   "camera1_stream"
               ],
               "AllowedClients": [
                   "*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Name": "example",
               "Type": "zmq_tcp",
               "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65015",
               "Topics": [
                   "*"
               ],
               "AllowedClients": [
                   "Visualizer", "VideoAnalytics"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

     - Type
     - Required (Mandatory)
     - Description
   * - ``Publishers``
     - ``array``
     - Yes
     - Entire publisher interface will be added with in the array. Multiple publish endpoints can be added by adding elements in the array.

     - Yes
     - Name of different publisher interfaces
   * - ``Type``
