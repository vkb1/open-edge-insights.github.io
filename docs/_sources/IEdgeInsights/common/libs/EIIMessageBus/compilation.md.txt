## Compilation

The EII Message Bus utilizes CMake as the build tool for compiling the library.
The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are shown below.

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

This will compile only the C library for the EII Message Bus. If you wish to
build with the Python binding, then specify the `WITH_PYTHON` flag when
executing the `cmake ` command (as shown below).

```sh
$ cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=ON ..
```

If you wish to include installation of the Go binding with the installation of
the EII library, then specify the `WITH_GO` flag when executing the `cmake`
command (as shown below).

```sh
$ cmake -DWITH_GO=ON ..
```

Note that this only copies the Go binding library to your system's `$GOPATH`.
If you do not have your `$GOPATH` specified in your system's environmental
variables then an error will occur while executing the `cmake` command.

In addition to the `WITH_PYTHON` and `WITH_GO` flags, the EII Message Bus
CMake files add flags for building the C examples and the unit tests associated
with the library. The table below specifies all of the available flags that can
be given to CMake for building the EII Message Bus.

|       Flag      | Default |                                       Description                                    |
| :-------------: | :-----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WITH_TESTS`    | `OFF`   | If set to `ON`, builds the C unit tests with the EII Message Bus compilation         |
| `WITH_EXAMPLES` | `OFF`   | If set to `ON`, then CMake will compile the C examples in addition to the library    |
| `WITH_DOCS`     | `OFF`   | If set to `ON`, then CMake will add a `docs` build target to generate documentation  |

> **NOTE:** These flags are in addition to any and all flags that are available
> for the `cmake` command. See the CMake documentation for additional flags.

> **NOTE:** See the [Generating Documentation](#generating-documentation)
> section.

If you wish to compile the EII Message Bus in debug mode, then you can set the
the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug` when executing the `cmake` command (as shown
below).

```sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

### Generating Documentation

Generating the documentation has several dependencies which are not installed
by the `install.sh` script. You must install the following packages in order
to generate the documentation:

```sh
$ sudo apt install doxygen texlive-full
```

**WARNING:** This install way take a very long time. It will install > `4GB` of
packages.

If you are building the Python binding (by using the `WITH_PYTHON` flag), then
you must also install Sphinx and an extension for Sphinx. This can be
accomplished with the following commands:

```sh
$ sudo apt install python3-sphinx
$ sudo -H -E pip3 install m2r
```
> **NOTE:** The commands above assume you already have Python 3.6 and pip
> installed on your system.

**Go documentation generation is WIP.**

Once you have completed these steps, the documentation can be generated by
running the following make command:

```sh
$ make docs && make docs
```

Note that currently you need to run `make docs` twice so that the table of
contents is generated correctly for each of the documents. This will be fixed
in the future.

The PDF documents will be in the `docs/pdfs/` directory within your `build`
directory. There will be other log files and output files associated with the
building of the PDFs. Any file that does not end in `.pdf` can be ignored.

### Potential Compilation Issues

- **CMake Python Version Issue:** If CMake raises an error for finding the
    incorrect Python version, then add the following flag to the CMake
    command: `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3`
- **Python Binding Changes Not Compiling:** If a change is made to the Python
    binding and make has already been previously ran, then you must run
    `make clean` before running make again to compile the changes in the
    Python binding. This will need to be fixed later.
