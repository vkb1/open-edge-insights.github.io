## Configuration

The EII Message Bus is configured through a `key, value` pair interface. The
values can be objects, arrays, integers, floating point, boolean, or strings.
The keys that are required to be available in the configuration are largly
determined by the underlying protocol which the message bus will use. The
protocol is specified via the `type` key and currently must be one of the
following:

- `zmq_ipc` - ZeroMQ over IPC protocol
- `zmq_tcp` - ZeroMQ over TCP protocol

The following sections specify the configuration attributes expected for the
TCP and IPC ZeroMQ protocols.

### ZeroMQ IPC Configuration

The ZeroMQ IPC protocol implementation only requires one configuration
attribute: `socket_dir`. The value of this attribute specifies the directory
where the message bus should create the Unix socket files to establish the IPC
based communication.

The ZeroMQ IPC protocol also supports a few optional configuration properties.
For all communication patterns (request/response and publisher/subscribe), the
`socket_file` property can be specified for any service name or publish/subscribe
topic. This makes it so that all communication happens over the specified socket
file, instead of the default, which is for the message bus to use the topic/service
name for the socket file name. This enables two specific use cases:

1. Having a single application publish multiple topics over a single IPC socket
    file
2. Connecting ZeroMQ IPC publishers to the ZeroMQ Broker

For the second use case, there is an additional property which must be specified;
the `brokered` configuration value. This is must be a boolean value, with `true`
telling the publisher to connect to the broker and `false` for not connecting.
Note that this value is not required. If it is `false` or is not specified, then
the publisher will not connect to a broker and will bind to the given `socket_file`
value.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

The `socket_file` value should only be the name of a file. The socket itself
will still be created in the specified `socket_dir` directory.

Also, both the `socket_file` and `brokered` values must be specified in the
configuration under an object with its key being the topic or service name.
An example of this is shown below.

```javascript
{
    // Specifies the ZeroMQ IPC protocol
    "type": "zmq_ipc",

    // Specifies the socket directory
    "socket_dir": "/tmp/socks",

    // The key, "example-topic", is the topic which the publisher shall publish
    // on. This could also be a service name.
    "example-topic": {
        // For the example-topic, the below property specifies the socket file
        // to use
        "socket_file": "socket-filename",

        // The below property is only supported by publishers, this specifies
        // that the given publisher will be brokered through the ZeroMQ Broker
        "brokered": true
    }
}
```

The example above uses JSON to represent the EII Message Bus configuration.
See the, "Examples", below section for more details and more examples.

### ZeroMQ TCP Configuration

The ZeroMQ TCP protocol has several configuration attributes which must be
specified based on the communication pattern the application is using and
based on the security the application wishes to enable for its communication.

#### Publishers

For an application which wishes to publish messages over specific topics, the
configuration must contain the key `zmq_tcp_publish`. This attribute must be
an object which has the following keys:

|          Key        |    Type   | Required |                         Description                          |
| :-----------------: | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `host`              | `string`  | Yes      | Specifies the host to publish as                             |
| `port`              | `int`     | Yes      | Specifies the port to publish messages on                    |
| `server_secret_key` | `string`  | No       | Specifies the secret key for the port for authentication     |
| `brokered`          | `boolean` | No       | Specifies whether or not to connect to the ZeroMQ Broker |

The `server_secret_key` must be a Curve Z85 encoded string value that is
specified if the application wishes to use CurveZMQ authentication with to
secure incoming connections from subscribers.

The `brokered` key must be a boolean value. This will determine whether or not
the publishers attempt to bind or connect to the given  TCP (host, port)
combination.

#### Subscribers

To subscribe to messages coming from a publisher over TCP, the configuration
must contain a key for the topic you wish to subscribe to. For example, if
*Application 1* were publishing on topic `sensor-1`, then the subscribing
application *Application 2* would need to contain a configuration key `sensor-1`
which contains the keys required to configure the TCP connection to
*Application 1*.

The key that can be specified for a subscribers configuration are outline in the
table below.

|          Key        |   Type   | Required |                         Description                        |
| :-----------------: | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`              | `string` | Yes      | Specifies the host of the publisher                        |
| `port`              | `int`    | Yes      | Specifies the port of the publisher                        |
| `server_public_key` | `string` | No       | Specifies the publisher's public key for authentication    |
| `client_secret_key` | `string` | No       | Specifies the subscribers's secret key for authentication  |
| `client_public_key` | `string` | No       | Specifies the subcribers's public key for authentication   |

> **NOTE:** If one of the `*_key` values is specifed, then all of them must be
> specified.

#### Services

The configuration to host a service to receive and respond to requests is
similar to the configuration for doing publications on a message bus context.
The only difference, is the configuration for a service is placed under a key
which is the name of the service.

For example, if *Application 1* wishes to host a service named `example-service`,
then the configuration must contain an a key called `example-service`. The value
for that key must be an object containing the keys listed in the table of
the Publishers section.

#### Requesters

The configuration to issue requests to a service is the exact same as a
subscriber. In the case of a requester, instead of the configuration being
under the name of the topic, the configuration is placed under the name of
the service it wishes to connect to. For the details of the allowed values,
see the table in the Subscribers section above.

#### Using ZAP Authentication

For services and publishers additional security can be enabled for all incoming
connections (i.e. requesters and subscribers). This method utilizes the ZMQ
ZAP protocol to verify the incoming client public keys against a list of
whitelisted clients.

The list of allowed clients is given to the message bus via the `allowed_clients`
key. This key must be a list of Z85 encoded CurveZMQ keys.

### Additional ZeroMQ Configuration Properties

The configuration interface for the ZeroMQ protocol exposes additional socket
properties. The table below specifies each of the supported properties.

|     Configuration      |  Type  |  Default |                                    Description                               |
| :--------------------: | :----: | :------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zmq_recv_hwm`         | `int`  | `1000`   | Sets `ZMQ_RCVHWM` socket property (queue size for pending received messages) |
| `zmq_connect_retries`  | `int`  | `1000`   | Sets number of connect failures before recreating ZMQ socket object          |
