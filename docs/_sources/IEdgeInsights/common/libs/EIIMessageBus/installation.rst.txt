Installation
------------

If you wish to install the EII Message Bus on your system, execute the
following command after building the library:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo make install

By default, this command will install the EII Message Bus C library into
``/opt/intel/eii/lib``. On some platforms this is not included in the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
by default. As a result, you must add this directory to you ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``\ ,
otherwise you will encounter issues using the EII Message Bus. This can
be accomplished with the following ``export``\ :

.. code-block:: sh

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib

.. note::  You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
   the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` flag. If different installation path is given via
   ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``\ , then ``$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` should be appended by
   $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.


Install Python Binding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the Python binding for the EII Message Bus execute the following
commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Change directories into the python/ directory
   $ cd python/

   # Install the Python package
   $ sudo python3 setup.py install

.. note::  In order for the installation to be successful, you must have run
   the ``install.sh`` script with the ``--cython`` flag when installing the
   message bus dependencies.


Install Golang Binding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the Golang binding for the EII Message Bus execute the following
command:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Copy the Golang source to your $GOPATH/src directory
   $ cp -a go/EIIMessageBus/ $GOPATH/src/

.. note::  The above command assumes Golang is installed and configured on
   the target system.
