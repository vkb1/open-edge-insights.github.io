## Security

The ZeroMQ protocol for the EII Message Bus enables to usage of
[CurveZMQ](http://curvezmq.org/) for encryption and authentication where the
[ZAP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27/ZAP/) protocol is used for the
authentication.

The ZeroMQ protocol for the message bus allows for using both CurveZMQ and ZAP
together, only CurveZMQ encryption, or no encryption/authentication for TCP
communication.

Enabling the security features is done through the configuration object which
is given to the `msgbus_initialize()` method. The example configurations below
showcase how to use the security features enabled in the message bus. It is
important to note that although the examples below use JSON to convey the
configurations it is not required that you use a JSON configuration for the
message bus. However, utilities are provided in the C library for the EII
message bus for using a JSON file to configure the bus.

### Using Only CurveZMQ Encryption

If you wish to use the message bus with only CurveZMQ encryption, then you
specify the following keys for the communication types specified in the
sections below.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** All keys must be Z85 encoded (see ZeroMQ documentation for
more information).

#### Publish/Subscribe

For publications over TCP, the configuration must contain a `server_secret_key`
value which the secret key of the Curve key pair that is Z85 encoded (see
the ZeroMQ documentation for more information).

Additionally, every subscriber configuration object (which is specified under
the key for the topic it is subscribing to) must contain the following three
keys: `server_public_key`, `client_public_key`, and `client_secret_key`.

**Example:**

Below is an example configuration in JSON (note: the keys are not Z85 encoded,
but are more clear text to help the example).

**Publisher Config:**

```json
{
    "type": "zmq_tcp",
    "zmq_tcp_publish": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3000,
        "server_secret_key": "publishers-secret-key"
    }
}
```

**Subscriber Config:**

```json
{
    "type": "zmq_tcp",
    "pub-sub-topic": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3000,
        "server_public_key": "publishers-public-key",
        "client_secret_key": "subscriber-secret-key",
        "client_public_key": "subscriber-public-key"
    }
}
```

In the example configurations above, it is assumed that the publisher is
sending messages on the `pub-sub-topic` topic.

#### Request/Response

For every service which is going to accept and respond to requests, there must
exist the `server_secret_key` in the configuration object for the service. The
key for the configuration of the service is its service name.

For every service which is going to issue requests to another service, there
must exist a configuration object for the destination service name which
contains the following three keys: `server_public_key`, `client_public_key`,
and `client_secret_key`.

**Example:**

**Service Config:**

```json
{
    "type": "zmq_tcp",
    "example-service": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3000,
        "server_secret_key": "service-secret-key"
    }
}
```

**Service Requester Config:**

```json
{
    "type": "zmq_tcp",
    "example-service": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3000,
        "server_public_key": "service-public-key",
        "client_secret_key": "service-requester-secret_key",
        "client_public_key": "service-requester-public-key"
    }
}
```

In the example above, the service requester will connect to the `example-service`
and issue requests to it on the port: `127.0.0.1:3000`.

### Using ZAP Authentication

To enable ZAP authentication protocol using CurveZMQ on top of the encryption,
then in the configuration specify the key `allowed_clients`. This key must have
a value which is a list of Z85 encoded strings which are the public keys of the
clients which are allowed to connect to the application.

For example, using the publish/subscribe example from before, to make it so
that only the subscriber client can connect to the publisher the publisher's
configuration would be modified to be the following:

```json
{
    "type": "zmq_tcp",
    "allowed_clients": ["subscriber-public-key"],
    "zmq_tcp_publish": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3000,
        "server_secret_key": "publishers-secret-key"
    }
}
```

### Disabling Security

To disable all encryption and authentication for TCP communication do not
specify any of the configuration keys documented above. This will cause the
message bus to initialize the ZeroMQ protocol without any of the CurveZMQ
security primitives.
