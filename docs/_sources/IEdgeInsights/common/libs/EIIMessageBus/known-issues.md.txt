## Known issues

Due to certain limitations imposed by cJSON, there is no proper distinction
between an integer and a floating point in **EIIMsgEnv**. As a result of this limitation,
the floating point values defined as whole numbers(1.0, 50.00 etc) are always deserialized
as integers(1, 50 etc) on the subscriber's end in C, Python & Go APIs.

The workaround for this limitation in the C APIs is to check for the type of
`msg_envelope_elem_body_t` struct before accessing the respective type's data. One such example
is provided below:

```c
msg_envelope_elem_body_t* data;
msgbus_ret_t ret = msgbus_msg_envelope_get(msg, "key", &data);
if (ret != MSG_SUCCESS) {
    LOG_ERROR_0("Failed to retreive message");
}
if (data->type == MSG_ENV_DT_INT) {
    LOG_INFO("Received integer: %d", data->body.integer);
} else if (data->type == MSG_ENV_DT_FLOATING) {
    LOG_INFO("Received float: %f", data->body.floating);
}
```
