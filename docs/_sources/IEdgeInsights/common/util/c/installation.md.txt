## Installation

> **NOTE:** This is a mandatory step to use this library in
> C/C++ EII modules and EII Message Bus library.

If you wish to install the EII Utils on your system, execute the
following command after building the library:

```sh
$ sudo make install
```

By default, this command will install the EII Utils C library into
`/opt/intel/eii/lib/`. On some platforms this is not included in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
by default. As a result, you must add this directory to you `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
This can be accomplished with the following `export`:

```sh
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib/
```

> **NOTE:** You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
> the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag. If different installation path is given via `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, then `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should be appended by $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.
