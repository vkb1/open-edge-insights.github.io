Compilation
-----------

Utilizes CMake as the build tool for compiling the library. The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are
shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make

If you wish to compile in debug mode, then you can set
the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` to ``Debug`` when executing the ``cmake`` command (as shown
below).

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
