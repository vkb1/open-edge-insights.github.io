``Chaining of UDFs``
------------------------

One can chain multiple native/python UDFs in the ``udfs`` key. The way chaining
works here is the output of the UDF listed first would send the modified frame
and metadata to the subsequent UDF and so on. One such classic example is having
``pcb.pcb_filter`` and ``pcb.pcb_classifier`` in VideoIngestion service config to
do both the pre-processing and the classification logic without the need of
VideoAnalytics service.

.. note:: \ :
   Dummy UDF can also be used for above use cases for testing chaining UDFs
   feature but as such there is no value add as it's a do-nothing UDF.
   In DEV Mode python udfs changes can be tested by restarting containers, no need to rebuild.
