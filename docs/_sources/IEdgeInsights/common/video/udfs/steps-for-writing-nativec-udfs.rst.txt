**Steps for writing native(c++) UDFs**
------------------------------------------

Every UDF writing has two major part to it.


* 
  Writing actual pre/post processing logic using EII exposed APIs.

* 
  Adding EII infra specific configuration component for deploying it

**EII APIs for Writing Native UDFs(c++)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three APIs defined semantically to add the pre/post processing logic. These APIs must be implemented as method of a user defined class inherited from the Udf class named **\ *BaseUdf*\ **.


* 
  #### **INITIALIZATION & DE-INITIALIZATION**

  .. code-block:: C++

           class DummyUdf : public BaseUdf {
                   public:
                       DummyUdf(config_t* config) : BaseUdf(config) {
                           //initialization Code can be added here
                       };

                       ~DummyUdf() {
                           // Any de-initialization logic to be added here
                       };
           };

    The **DummyUdf** in the above code snippet is the user defined class and the constructor of the class initialize the UDF's specific data-structure. The only argument passed to this function is **config** which depicts configuration details mentioned in the ``config.json`` file of apps liks VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics which process UDFs. The API to consume **config** is defined in `Util README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/util/c/README.md>`_


* 
  #### **PROCESSING THE ACTUAL DATA**

    The API to utilize the ingested input looks as below:

  .. code-block:: C++

       UdfRetCode
       process(cv::Mat& frame, cv::Mat& outputFrame, msg_envelope_t* meta) override {
           // Logic for processing the frame & returning the inference result.
       }

    This function is a override method which user need to define in its UDF file.

    The *argument* details are described as below:


  * 
    **Argument 1(cv::Mat &frame)**\ : It represents the input frame for inference.

  * 
    **Argument 2(cv::Mat &outputFrame)**\ : It represents the modified frame by the user. This can be used if user need to pass a modified frame forward.

  * 
    **Argument 3(msg_envelope_t* meta)**\ : It represents the inference result returned by UDF. The user need to fill the **msg_envelope_t** structure as described in following `\ **EIIMsgEnv README** <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/libs/EIIMsgEnv/README.md>`_. There are sample code suggested in the README which explains the API usage in detail.

    The *return* code details are  described as below:

  * 
    **UdfRetCode**\ : User need to return appropriate macro as mentioned below:


    * **UDF_OK** - UDF has processed the frame gracefully.
    * **UDF_DROP_FRAME** - The frame passed to process function need to be dropped.
    * **UDF_ERROR** - it should be returned for any kind of error in UDF.

* 
  #### **LINKING UdfLoader AND CUSTOM-UDF**

    The **initialize_udf()** function need to defined as follows to create a link between UdfLoader module and respective UDF. This function ensure UdfLoader to call proper constructor and process() function of respective UDF.

  .. code-block:: C++

       extern "C" {
           void *initialize_udf(config_t *config) {
               DummyUdf *udf = new DummyUdf(config);
               return (void *)udf;
           }
       }

    The **"DummyUdf"** is the class name of the user defined custom UDF.

**EII APIs for Writing Raw Native UDFs(c++) for Multi Frame Support**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three APIs defined semantically to add the pre/post processing logic. These APIs must be implemented as method of a user defined class inherited from the Udf class named **\ *RawUdf*\ **.


* 
  #### **INITIALIZATION & DE-INITIALIZATION**

  .. code-block:: C++

           class RealSenseUdf : public RawBaseUdf {
                   public:
                       RealSenseUdf(config_t* config) : RawBaseUdf(config) {
                           //initialization Code can be added here
                       };

                       ~RealSenseUdf() {
                           // Any de-initialization logic to be added here
                       };
           };

    The **RealSenseUdf** in the above code snippet is the user defined class and the constructor of the class initialize the UDF's specific data-structure. The only argument passed to this function is **config** which depicts configuration details mentioned in the ``config.json`` file of apps liks VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics which process UDFs. The API to consume **config** is defined in `Util README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/util/c/README.md>`_

  #### **PROCESSING THE ACTUAL DATA**

    The API to utilize the ingested input looks as below:

  .. code-block:: C++

       UdfRetCode
       process(Frame* frame) override {
           // Logic for processing the frame & returning the inference result.
       }

    This function is a override method which user need to define in its UDF file.

    The *argument* details are described as below:


  * 
    **Argument 1(Frame* frame)**\ : It represents the frame object.

    The *return* code details are  described as below:

  * 
    **UdfRetCode**\ : User need to return appropriate macro as mentioned below:


    * **UDF_OK** - UDF has processed the frame gracefully.
    * **UDF_DROP_FRAME** - The frame passed to process function need to be dropped.
    * **UDF_ERROR** - it should be returned for any kind of error in UDF.

* 
  #### **LINKING UdfLoader AND CUSTOM-UDF**

    The **initialize_udf()** function need to defined as follows to create a link between UdfLoader module and respective UDF. This function ensure UdfLoader to call proper constructor and process() function of respective UDF.

  .. code-block:: C++

       extern "C" {
           void *initialize_udf(config_t *config) {
               RealSenseUdf *udf = new RealSenseUdf(config);
               return (void *)udf;
           }
       }

    The **"RealSenseUdf"** is the class name of the user defined custom UDF.

**EII INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED CHANGES**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the check-list one has to ensure to be completed before exercising C++ UDF.


#. 
   All the code specific to UDF should be kept under one directory which should be placed under **.../common/video/udfs/native** directory.

#. 
   Write appropriate **\ *CMakeLists.txt*\ ** file and link appropriate external library based on the code. Currently two sample CMAKE files are defined for two different use-case.


   * [ Dummy UDF's CMakeLists.txt file] (./native/dummy/CMakeLists.txt)
   * `Safety Gear Demo CMakeLists.txt file <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/native/safety_gear_demo/CMakeLists.txt>`_

#. 
   If the OpenVINO is used kindly follow the `safety_gear_demo <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/video/udfs/native/safety_gear_demo>`_ example for proper linking of  **cpu_extension.so** shared object.

#. 
   An appropriate entry must exist for each UDF that need to be loaded as part of EII deployment. The UDF entry syntax is explained in detail in the following document `UDF README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/blob/master/udfs/README.md>`_
