``Construction of Metadata in UDF``
---------------------------------------

If EII Visualizer/WebVisualizer clients are used for visualizing the classified frames, then please follow the metadata guidelines mentioned in **\ ``Metadata Structure``\ ** in `Visualizer <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-native-visualizer/blob/master/README.md>`_ / `WebVisualizer <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-web-visualizer/blob/master/README.md>`_ README respectively.

**Note**\ : User has to make sure that the data with in meta data should be of type list, tuple, dict or primitive data types (int, float, string or bool). Also, data with in list, tuple, dict
must contain only primitive data types.
Eg: Any data is of type "numpy.float" or "numpy.int" should be type-casted to float and int respectively.
