## Dependencies

* python3 (for python) installed
* Install databus_requirements.txt (for python) by running cmd: `sudo -H pip3.6 install -r  databus_requirements.txt`

  **Note**: It is highly recommended that you use a python virtual environment to
  install the python packages, so that the system python installation doesn't
  get altered. Details on setting up and using python virtual environment can
  be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/

* Install open62541 library dependencies (mbedTLS, python dev):

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install -y libmbedtls-dev python3-dev
  ```

  > **NOTE**: If `OpcuaBusAbstraction` module is referred from dist_libs path, make sure that the `sub` client is also run on Ubuntu > 18.04 as the dist libs package is been created by a container with ubuntu 18.04 as the base image. If working from IEI repo,
  > one shouldn't be bothered about this

* Set `PYTHONPATH` env variable to OpcuaBusAbstraction/py folder path

  * If executing from IEI repo path, set it as below:

    ```sh
    export PYTHONPATH=..:../../../../common/
    ```

  * If executing from IEI dist libs path (/opt/intel/iei/dist_libs). set it as below:

    ```sh
    export PYTHONPATH=..
    ```


* Copying certs and keys:
  * Copy opcua client cert and key to /etc/ssl/opcua
