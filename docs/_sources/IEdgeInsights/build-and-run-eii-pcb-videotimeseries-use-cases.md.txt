# Build and Run EII PCB video/timeseries use cases

  ---
  > **Note:**
  > * For running EII services in IPC mode, make sure that the same user should be there in publisher and subscriber.
     If publisher is running as root (eg: VI, VA), then the subscriber also need to run as root.
     In [docker-compose.yml](build/docker-compose.yml) if `user: ${EII_UID}` is in publisher service, then the
     same `user: ${EII_UID}` has to be in subscriber service. If the publisher doesn't have the user specified like above,
     then the subscriber service should not have that too.
  > * If services needs to be running in multiple nodes in TCP mode of communication, msgbus subscribers and clients of `AppName` are required to configure the "EndPoint" in config.json with HOST_IP and PORT under "Subscribers/Publishers" or "Clients/Servers" interfaces section.
  > * Make sure the PORT is being exposed in [docker-compose.yml](build/docker-compose.yml) of the respective `AppName`
    Eg: If the `"EndPoint": <HOST_IP>:60012` is configured in `config.json`, then expose the port 60012 in [docker-compose.yml](build/docker-compose.yml) of the service `ia_video_ingestion`

    ```yaml
      ia_video_ingestion:
        ...
        ports:
          - 65012:65012
    ```

All the below EII build and run commands needs to be executed from the `[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/` directory.

Below are the usecases supported by EII to bring up the respective services mentioned in the
yaml file.
