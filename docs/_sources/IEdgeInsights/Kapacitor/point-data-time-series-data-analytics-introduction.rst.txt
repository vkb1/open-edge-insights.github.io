Point-data (Time-series data) analytics introduction
====================================================

Any integral value that gets generated over time, we can say it is a point data.
The examples can be :


* Temperature at a different time in a day.
* Number of oil barrels processed per minute.

By doing the analytics over point data, the factory can have an anomaly detection mechanism.
That's where the PointDataAnalytics come into the picture.

IEdgeInsights uses the `TICK stack <https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/>`_
to do point data analytics.

IEdgeInsights has a temperature anomaly detection example for demonstrating the time-series data analytics flow.

The high-level flow of the data, in the example, can be seen as MQTT-temp-sensor-->Telegraf-->Influx-->Kapacitor-->Influx.

MQTT-temp-sensor simulator sends the data to the Telegraf. Telegraf just sends the same data to the
Influx and Influx send it to Kapacitor. Kapacitor does anomaly detection and publishes the results back to
Influx.

Here,
Telegraf is the TICK stack component and supporting the number of input plug-ins for data ingestion.
Influx is a time-series database.
Kapacitor is an analytics engine where users can write custom analytics plug-ins (TICK scripts).
