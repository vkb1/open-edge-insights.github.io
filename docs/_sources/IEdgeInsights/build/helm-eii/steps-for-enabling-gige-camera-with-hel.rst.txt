Steps for Enabling GiGE Camera with helm
----------------------------------------

**Note:** For more information on ``Multus`` please refer this git https://github.com/intel/multus-cni
 Skip installing multus if it is already installed.


#. 
   Prequisites
   For enabling gige camera with helm. Helm pod networks should be enabled ``Multus`` Network Interface
   to attach host system network interface access by the pods for connected camera access.

   **Note**\ : Please follow the below steps & make sure ``dhcp daemon`` is running fine.If there is an error on ``macvlan`` container creation on accessing the socket or if socket was not running. Please execute the below steps again

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo rm -f /run/cni/dhcp.sock
      $ cd /opt/cni/bin
      $ sudo ./dhcp daemon

   ### Setting up Multus CNI and Enabling it.


   * Multus CNI is a container network interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes that enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Typically, in Kubernetes each pod only has one network interface (apart from a loopback) -- with Multus you can create a multi-homed pod that has multiple interfaces. This is accomplished by Multus acting as a "meta-plugin", a CNI plugin that can call multiple other CNI plugins.


   #. Get the name of the ``ethernet`` interface in which gige camera & host system connected
      **Note**\ : Identify the network interface name by following command

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ ifconfig


   #. Execute the Following Script with Identified ``ethernet`` interface name as Argument for ``Multus Network Setup``
      **Note:** Pass the ``interface`` name without ``quotes``

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/helm-eii/gige_setup
      $ sudo -E sh ./multus_setup.sh <interface_name>

   ..

      **Note**\ : Verify ``multus`` pod is in ``Running`` state

      .. code-block:: sh

           $ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -i multus



   #. Set gige_camera to true in values.yaml

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ vi [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/helm/values.yaml
      .
      .
      .
      gige_camera: true
      .
      .
      .


   #. 
      Follow the `Deployment Steps <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/build/helm-eii/##Provision-and-deploy-in-the-kubernetes-node>`_

   #. 
      Verify ``pod``\ ip & ``host`` ip are same as per Configured ``Ethernet`` interface by using below command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ kubectl -n eii exec -it <pod_name> -- ip -d address

   **Note:**

   User needs to deploy as root user for MYRIAD(NCS2) device and GenICam USB3.0 interface cameras.
