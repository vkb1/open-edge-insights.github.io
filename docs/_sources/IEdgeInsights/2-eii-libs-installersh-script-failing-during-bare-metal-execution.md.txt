- Problem Description:

  One might run into issue of $GOPATH not being set appropriately which could result in the EII librarires installation failure when run on bare-metal

- Possible Cause:

        If "GO" is already installed in the system, eii_libs_installer script skips the installation of it.

        In this case where GO is already installed, GOPATH needs to be set in the system. If not, then above error occurs.

- Solution:

  Installing GO through eii_libs_installer script will install GO and set the required env variables like GOPATH. If not, then one need to set GOPATH
  environment variable with appropriate path.

  ```sh
  $ export GOPATH=<path_to_where_GO_is_installed>
  ```
