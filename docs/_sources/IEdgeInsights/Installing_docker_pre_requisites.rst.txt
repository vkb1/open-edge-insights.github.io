Manual steps to install docker daemon and docker-compose with proxy settings configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#. 
   Install latest docker cli/docker daemon by following\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
   https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce. Follow ``Install using
   the repository`` and ``Install Docker CE`` (follow first 2 steps) sections there. Also, follow the
   manage docker as a non-root user section at\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
   https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/ to run docker without sudo

#. 
   Please follow the below steps only if the node/system on which the docker setup is tried out is\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
   running behind a HTTP proxy server. If that's not the case, this step can be skipped.


   * 
     Configure proxy settings for docker client to connect to internet and for containers to access
     internet by following https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/. Sample proxy 
     config that could be going into ~/.docker/config.json would look like below
     with appropriate proxy server and ports added.

     .. code-block:: json

           {
               "proxies":
                   {
                       "default":
                       {
                           "httpProxy": "http://<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>",
                           "httpsProxy": "http://<proxy_server:<proxy_port>",
                           "noProxy": "127.0.0.1,localhost,<localadmin>"
                       }
                   }
           }

   * 
     Configure proxy settings for docker daemon by following the steps at 
     https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy. Use the values for http proxy 
     and https proxy as used in previous step.

     The correct DNS servers need to be updated to the /etc/resolv.conf

     .. code-block::

        A. Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier

           For Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier, /etc/resolv.conf was dynamically generated by NetworkManager.

           Comment out the line dns=dnsmasq (with a #) in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

           Restart the NetworkManager to regenerate /etc/resolv.conf :
           sudo systemctl restart network-manager

           Verify on the host: cat /etc/resolv.conf

        B. Ubuntu 18.04 and later

           Ubuntu 18.04 changed to use systemd-resolved to generate /etc/resolv.conf. Now by default it uses a local DNS cache 127.0.0.53. That will not work inside a container, so Docker will default to Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS server, which may break for people behind a firewall.

           /etc/resolv.conf is actually a symlink (ls -l /etc/resolv.conf) which points to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf (127.0.0.53) by default in Ubuntu 18.04.

           Just change the symlink to point to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, which lists the real DNS servers:
           sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

           Verify on the host: cat /etc/resolv.conf

#. 
   Install docker-compose tool by following this\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
   https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose
