Build and Run EII video/timeseries use cases
============================================

----

.. note:: 


   * For running EII services in IPC mode, make sure that the same user should be there in publisher and subscriber.
        If publisher is running as root (eg: VI, VA), then the subscriber also need to run as root.
        In ``build/docker-compose.yml`` if ``user: ${EII_UID}`` is in publisher service, then the
        same ``user: ${EII_UID}`` has to be in subscriber service. If the publisher doesn't have the user specified like above,
        then the subscriber service should not have that too.
   * If services needs to be running in multiple nodes in TCP mode of communication, msgbus subscribers and clients of ``AppName`` are required to configure the "EndPoint" in config.json with HOST_IP and PORT under "Subscribers/Publishers" or "Clients/Servers" interfaces section.
   * Make sure the PORT is being exposed in ``build/docker-compose.yml`` of the respective ``AppName``
       Eg: If the ``"EndPoint": <HOST_IP>:65012`` is configured in ``config.json``\ , then expose the port 65012 in ``build/docker-compose.yml`` of the service ``ia_video_ingestion``


.. code-block::

   ```yaml
     ia_video_ingestion:
       ...
       ports:
         - 65012:65012
   ```
