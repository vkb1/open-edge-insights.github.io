> **NOTE:** Outside of the Azure ecosystem, EII can be deployed and communicate
> across nodes. In the Azure IoT Edge ecosystem this is not possible with EII.
> All EII services must be running on the same edge node. However, you can
> deploy EII on multiple nodes, but intercommunication between the nodes will
> not work.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
> If you are using TCP communication between VI or VA and the Azure Bridge,
> then you must modify the `AllowedClients` list under the `Publishers` section
> of the interfaces configuration of VI or VA to include `AzureBridge`.
> This must be done prior to provisioning to that the proper certificates will
> be generated to encrypt/authenticate connections.

In the Azure IoT ecosystem you can deploy to single-nodes and you can do bulk
deployments. This section will cover how to deploy the Azure Bridge and
associated EII services to a single Linux edge node. For more details on deploying
modules at scale with the Azure IoT Edge Runtime, see
[this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-monitor)

Note that this section will give a high-level overview of how to deploy the
modules with the Azure CLI. For more information on developing and deploying
Azure modules, see [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-develop-for-linux).

The deloyment of the Azure IoT Edge and the EII modules can be broken down into
the following steps:

1. Provisioning
2. Configuring EII
3. Configuring Azure IoT Deployment Manifest
4. Deployment

Prior to deploying a single Azure IoT Edge node you must have already
configured your Azure cloud instance (see instructions in the [Azure Cloud Setup](#az-cloud-setup)
section). Additionally, you need to have already built and pushed the EII services to your
Azure Container Registry (follow the instructions in the [Build and Push EII Containers](#eii-build-push)
section).

Provided you have met these two prerequisites, follow the steps below to do a
single node deployment with the Azure Bridge on the Azure IoT Edge Runtime.

### Step 1 - Provisioning

The provisioning must take place on the node you wish to deploy your Azure IoT
Edge modules onto.

> **NOTE:** This may be your development system, which was setup earlier. Keep in
> mind, however, that having your system setup as a development system and a
> targeted node for a single-node deployment should never be done in production.

First, you must then install the Azure IoT Edge Runtime on your target deployment
system. To do that, follow the instructions provided by Microsoft in
[this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux).

Next, you must provision on your target deployment system. Follow the instructions
provided in the EII READMEs/User Guide for completing this process.

While provisioning on your system, note that you only need to setup the
Video Ingesiton and/or the Video Analytics containers. All other services are
not supported by the Azure Bridge currently.

Be sure to note down which directory you generate your certificates into, this
will be important later. Unless, you are running EII in dev mode, in that case
you will have no certificates generated.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

If you previously installed EII outside of Azure on your system, then make sure
that all of the EII containers have been stopped. You can do this by going to
the `build/` directory in the EII source code and running the following command:

```sh
$ docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all of the previously running EII containers, allowing
the Azure Bridge to run successfully.

#### Expected Result

When you have completed these steps, you should have the Azure IoT Edge Runtime
installed (which includes Docker), and you should have the `ia_etcd` EII container
running on your system.

To confirm this, run the `docker ps` command. Your output should look similar to
the following:

```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
75121173d4d8        ia_etcd:2.3         "./start_etcd.sh"   11 days ago         Up 2 seconds                            ia_etcd
```

### Step 2 - Configuring EII

This step should be done from your development system, and not the edge node you
are deploying EII onto. The configuration you will do during this setup will
allow your system to deploy EII to your edge node. As noted earlier, for development
and testing purposes this could be the same system as your targeted edge device,
but this is not recommended in a production environment.

To configure EII, modify the `build/provision/config/eii_config.json` file. This
should have been generated when the `build/builder.py` script was executed
when building/pushing the EII containers to your ACR instance. If it does not
exist, run this script based on the instructions provided in the EII README.

Next, configure the `build/.env` file. You must make sure to modify the following
values in the `.env` file:

* `DOCKER_REGISTRY` - This should have been set when building/pushing the EII
    containers to your ACR instance. Make sure it is set to the URL for your
    ACR instance.
* `HOST_IP` - This must be the IP address of the edge node you are deploying
    your containers to
* `ETCD_HOST` - This should be set to the same value as your `HOST_IP` address
* `DEV_MODE` - Set this to the same value you used when provisioning your edge node
    in the previous step

Next, in the `AzureBridge/` source directory, modify the `.env` file. Make
sure to set the following values:

* `EII_CERTIFICATES`              - The directory with the EII certificates on your edge system
* `AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTY_USERNAME` - User name for the container registry login (obtained during creation)
* `AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTY_PASSWORD` - Password for the container registry login (obtained during creation)
    * **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure to surround the password in single quotes, i.e. `'`, because bash
        may escape certain characters when the file is read, leading to incorrect configuration
* `AZ_BLOB_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`  - **(OPTIONAL)** User name for the local Azure Blob Storage instance

**IMPORTANT NOTE #1:**

It is important to note that for the `AZ_CONTAINER_REGISTY_PASSWORD` variable you
must wrap the password in single quotes, i.e. `'`. Otherwise, there may be
characters that get escaped in a weird way when the values are populated into
your deployment manifest leading to configuration errors.

**IMPORTANT NOTE #2:**

If you wish to use the sample EII ONNX UDF, now is the time to configure the UDF
to run. See the [Sample EII ONNX UDF](#sample-eii-onnx-udf) configuration section
below for how to configure the UDF.

#### Expected Result

Once the following step has been completed, then you should have correctly configured
`.env` files to deploying EII via Azure. If some of the values were incorrect, then
you will encounter issues in the proceeding steps.

### Step 3 - Configuring Azure IoT Deployment Manifest

Once you have your target edge system provisioned and EII configured, you need to
create your Azure IoT Hub deployment manifest. The Azure Bridge provides some
convenience scripts to ease this process.

> **NOTE:** These steps should be done from your development system setup in
> the [Development System Setup](#dev-sys-setup) section. Note, that for testing
> and development purposes, these could be the same system.

To generate your deployment manifest template, execute the following command:

```sh
$ ./tools/generate-deployment-manifest.sh example AzureBridge SimpleSubscriber ia_video_ingestion ia_video_analytics
```

> **NOTE:** If you are using Azure Blob Storage, include `AzureBlobStorageonIoTEdge`
> in the argument list above.

> **NOTE:** When you run the command above, it will pull some values from your
> EII `build/.env` file. If the `build/.env` file is configured incorrectly,
> you may run into issues.

The above command will generate two files: `./example.template.json` and
`config/example.amd64.json`. The first is a deployment template, and the second
is the fully populated/generated configuration for Azure IoT Hub. In executing
the script above, you should have a manifest which includes the Azure Bridge,
Simple Subscriber, as well as the EII video ingestion service.

The list of services given to the bash script can be changed if you wish to
run different services.

You may want/need to modify your `./example.template.json` file after running
this command. This could be because you wish to change the topics that VI/VA use
or because you want to configure the Azure Bridge in some different way. If you
modify this file, you must regenerate the `./config/example.amd64.json` file.
To do this, execute the following command:

```sh
$ iotedgedev genconfig -f example.template.json
```

If you wish to modify your `eii_config.json` file after generating your template,
you can re-add this to the Azure Bridge digital twin by running the following
command:

```sh
$ python3 tools/serialize_eii_config.py example.template.json ../build/provision/config/eii_config.json
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

If you wish to have the AzureBridge subscribe and bridge data over an IPC
socket coming from either Video Ingestion or Video Analytics, then you must
change the user which the container operates under. By default, the AzureBridge
container is configured to run as the `eiiuser` created during the installation of
EII on your edge system. Both Video Ingestion and Video Analytics operate as root
in order to access various accelerators on your system. This results in the
IPC sockets for the communication with these modules being created as root. To
have the AzureBridge subscribe it must also run as root. To change this, do
the following steps:

1. Open your deployment manifest template
2. Under the following JSON key path: `modulesContent/modules/AzureBridge/settings/createOptions`
    delete the `User` key

This will cause the container to be launched as `root` by default allowing you to
subscribe to IPC sockets created as root.

#### Expected Result

If all of the commands above ran correctly, then you will have a valid `*.template.json`
file and a valid `config/*.amd64.json` file.

If, for some reason, these commands fail, revisit Step 2 and make sure all of your
environmental variables are set correctly. And if that does not resolve your issue,
verify that your development system is setup correctly by revisiting the
[Development System Setup](#dev-sys-setup) section.

### Step 4 - Deployment

Now that you have generated your deployment manifest, deploy the modules to your
Azure IoT Edge Device using the Azure CLI command shown below:

```sh
$ az iot edge set-modules -n <azure-iot-hub-name> -d <azure-iot-edge-device-name> -k config/<deployment-manifest>
```

If this command run successfully, then you will see a large JSON string print out
on the console with information on the deployment which it just initiated. If it
failed, then the Azure CLI will output information on the potential reason for the
failure.

#### Expected Results

Provided all of the setups above ran correctly, your edge node should now be running
your Azure IoT Edge modules, the Azure Bridge, and the EII services you
selected.

It is possible that for the Azure Bridge (and any Python Azure IoT Edge modules)
you will see that the service crashes the first couple of times it attempts to come
up on your edge system with an exception similar to the following:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/azure/iot/device/common/mqtt_transport.py", line 340, in connect
        host=self._hostname, port=8883, keepalive=DEFAULT_KEEPALIVE
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/paho/mqtt/client.py", line 937, in connect
        return self.reconnect()
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/paho/mqtt/client.py", line 1071, in reconnect
        sock = self._create_socket_connection()
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/paho/mqtt/client.py", line 3522, in _create_socket_connection
        return socket.create_connection(addr, source_address=source, timeout=self._keepalive)
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/socket.py", line 728, in create_connection
        raise err
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/socket.py", line 716, in create_connection
        sock.connect(sa)
    ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

This occurs because the container is starting before the `edgeHub` container for
the Azure IoT Edge Runtime has come up, and so it it unable to connect. Once the
`edgeHub` container is fully launched, then this should go away and the containers
should launch correctly.

If everything is running smoothly, you should see messages being printed in the
Simple Subscriber service using the following command:

```sh
$ docker logs -f SimpleSubscriber
```

For more debugging info, see the following section.

### Helpful Debugging Commands

If you are encountering issues, the following commands can help with debugging:

* **Azure IoT Edge Runtime Daemon Logs:** `journalctl -u iotedge -f`
* **Container Logs:** `docker logs -f <CONTAINER-NAME>`
