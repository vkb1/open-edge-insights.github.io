# Azure Bridge

> **NOTE:** The source code for this project must be placed under the `IEdgeInsights`
> directory in the source code for EII for the various scripts and commands in
> this README to work.

The Azure Bridge serves as a connector between EII and the Microsoft
Azure IoT Edge Runtime ecosystem. It does this by allowing the following
forms of bridging:

* Publishing of incoming data from EII onto the Azure IoT Edge Runtime bus
* Storage of incoming images from the EII video analytics pipeline into a
    local instance of the Azure Blob Storage service
* Translation of configuration for EII from the Azure IoT Hub digital twin
    for the bridge into ETCD via the EII Configuration Manager APIs

This code base is structured as an Azure IoT Edge Runtime module. It includes:

* Deployment templates for deploying the EII video analytics pipeline with the
    bridge on top of the Azure IoT Edge Runtime
* The Azure Bridge module
* A simple subscriber on top of the Azure IoT Edge Runtime for showcasing the
    end-to-end transmission of data
* Various utilities and helper scripts for deploying and developing on the
    Azure Bridge

The following sections will cover the configuration/usage of the Azure
Bridge, the deployment of EII on the Azure IoT Edge Runtime, as well as the
usage of the tools and scripts included in this code base for development.

> **NOTE:** The following sections assume an understanding of the configuration
> for EII. It is recommended that you read the main README and User Guide for
> EII prior to using this service.
