Running Unit Tests
------------------

The Azure Bridge contains unit tests for various utility functions in the
service. It does not contain unit tests for every single method, because most
of it is not unit test-able, meaning, you must have a fully up and running Azure
IoT Edge Runtime in order to run the code succesfully. Testing the bridge in
this way can be accomplished via using the Azure IoT Edge Runtime simulator
documented in the root directory of the Azure Bridge service.

To run the unit tests for the Azure Bridge, first install the Azure
Bridge python dependencies:

Note: It is highly recommended that you use a python virtual environment to 
install the python packages, so that the system python installation doesn't 
get altered. Details on setting up and using python virtual environment can 
be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/ 

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo -H -E pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Next, setup your ``PYTHONPATH`` to contian the necessary EII Python libraries for
the test:

.. note::  This can be skipped if you have installed the EII libraries on your
   system already. This step assumes none of the EII libraries for Python, Go,
   or C have been installed on your system.


.. code-block:: sh

   $ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:../../../common:../../../common/libs/ConfigManager/python

Next, run the unit tests with the following Python command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python3 -m unittest discover

If everything runs successfully, you should see the following output:

.. code-block::
