## Docker Pre-requisities

1. **Installing docker daemon and docker-compose tools with proxy settings configuration**.

  Please follow the steps mentioned in [Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md](./Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md) for installing docker daemon and docker-compose tool

2. **Optional:** For enabling full security, make sure host machine and docker daemon are configured with below security recommendations. [build/docker_security_recommendation.md](build/docker_security_recommendation.md)

3. **Optional:** If one wishes to enable log rotation for docker containers

    There are two ways to configure logging driver for docker containers

    * Set logging driver as part of docker daemon (**applies to all docker containers by default**):

        * Configure `json-file` driver as default logging driver by following [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/). Sample json-driver config which can be copied to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` is provided below.

            ```
            {
                "log-driver": "json-file",
                "log-opts": {
                "max-size": "10m",
                "max-file": "5"
                }
            }
            ```

        * Reload the docker daemon
            ```
            $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            ```
        * Restart docker
            ```
            $ sudo systemctl restart docker
            ```

    * Set logging driver as part of docker compose which is conatiner specific and which always overwrites 1st option (i.e /etc/docker/daemon.json)

        Example to enable logging driver only for video_ingestion service:

        ```
        ia_video_ingestion:
            ...
            ...
            logging:
             driver: json-file
             options:
              max-size: 10m
              max-file: 5
        ```
