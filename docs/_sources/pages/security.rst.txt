Security
================

The primary security objective of the EII is to prevent time series and video data generated by the ingestion / analytic components from being accessed by unauthorized entities acting within the system or accessing it via the external network interfaces. 

Security is enabled in a two-stage process involving provisioning and execution on an edge compute node. The root user is considered a trusted entity; therefore, compromising the root password or giving Linux* sudoer permission to an untrusted user on the edge compute node will compromise security.

Provisioning
============

Provisioning must be done before deploying EII on any node. Provisioning will start EII ConfigMgr as a container and load it with the configuration required to run EII for single or multi-node cluster setup.

The provisioning step of EII includes:

#.	Loading the initial EII ConfigMgr values from a json file.
#.	Generating EII ConfigMgr user certificates for all applications.
#.	Generating required X509 certificates and putting them in EII ConfigMgr.
#.	Joining the node to the EII ConfigMgr cluster.

Generating Keys and Certificates
--------------------------------

EII is provided with a cert-tool that can create EII ConfigMgr private keys and cert pair for all EII containers. The cert-tool is a sample that’s uses OpenSSL commands to create the X.509 certs and private keys with names expected by the sample docker-compose.yml provided with the release. The user can opt to generate these certs using any tool and update the docker-compose.yml with the corresponding names for the final deployment.

The following certificates are generated by the cert-tool:

X.509 CA certificate, which is self-signed. This step can be omitted if the admin provides their own pre-generated CA certificate to the tool.

EII ConfigMgr root user private key and certificate.

EII ConfigMgr user private key and certificate for all the applications (provided in the configuration).

EII ConfigMgr peer certificate to be generated for each node in the cluster.

The cert-tool will generate these keys and certificates and will keep them in a “Certificates/” directory with unique filenames for each certificate. This directory will be referred by the docker-compose.yml file for mounting these as secrets to the container.

Start Up and Run Time
======================

During Edge Compute Node reboot, the secrets stored in the EII ConfigMgr need to be accessible to all of the EII infrastructure containers. EII ConfigMgr plays a crucial role in providing the secrets to other containers. 

Accessing Secrets
------------------

Docker-compose secret and EII ConfigMgr are used to provide runtime secrets to EII.

Application reads the EII ConfigMgr certificates from the secrets of docker-compose.

Call the ConfigMgr library (EII ConfigMgr client) for reading the application configurations (using the EII user EII ConfigMgr pub/pri key pair).

Read the message bus topics and message bus configurations for Pub / Sub and Request Response along with the ZMQ private keys.

For a publisher, the application needs the public keys of all subscribers. From the list of subscribers mentioned in the application EII ConfigMgr configuration, the application needs to query the ConfigMgr and gets the public keys of all subscribers from EII ConfigMgr. The application will pass this configuration to the EII message bus.

For a subscriber, the ConfigMgr is used for getting the public key of the publisher and connecting to it.

Certificate Revocation
======================

Individual users can be deleted from the EII ConfigMgr to revoke their certificates. In case of ZeroMQ* certificate revocation, the client’s public key can be removed from the allowed_clients option of the publisher.
