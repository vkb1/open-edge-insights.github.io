It’s best to think about Industrial EII from Intel as a set of containers. Figure 2 depicts these containers as dashed lines around the components held by each container. The high-level functions of EII are data ingestion (video and time-series), data storage, data analytics, as well as data and device management.

      Figure 2.   EII Ingredients

This EII configuration is designed for deployment near to the site of data generation (for example, a PLC, robotic arm, tool, video camera, sensor, etc.). The EII Docker* containers perform video and time-series data ingestion, real-time\ :sub:`1` analytics, and allow closed-loop control\ :sub:`2`. 
The following sections describe how to add new ingestion streams or algorithms within the EII Docker* containers, as well as how to connect external applications (such as a Human Machine Interface (HMI) or a Manufacturing Execution System (MES)) to the EII.

.. note::  1. Real-time measurements, as tested by Intel, are as low as 50 milliseconds. 

.. note::  2. EII closed-loop control functions do not provide deterministic control.
